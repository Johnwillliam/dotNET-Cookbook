# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is used when you need to control access to a single instance of a class, such as a configuration manager, logging service, or database connection.

## Example

Let's create a simple example of a Singleton class in C#.

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton()
    {
        // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
    }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (instance == null)
            {
                instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // Perform some action.
    }
}
```

In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor and a public Instance property that ensures only one instance of Singleton is created. You can access this instance using Singleton.Instance.

## Use Cases

The Singleton pattern is useful in scenarios where you need a single point of control, such as:

- Managing a configuration manager.
- Controlling access to a shared resource (e.g., a database connection).
- Implementing a logging service.
- By using the Singleton pattern, you ensure that there is only one instance of the class, which helps manage shared resources efficiently.

## Benefits

- Guarantees a single instance of the class.
- Provides a global point of access to that instance.
- Efficiently manages shared resources.

## Drawbacks

- Can lead to tight coupling in the code.
- Can make unit testing more challenging.
