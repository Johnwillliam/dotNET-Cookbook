# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is used to ensure that a system is independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented, and to promote the creation of families of objects.

## Example

Let's create a simple example of the Abstract Factory Pattern in C# for creating furniture (chairs and tables) with two different styles: Modern and Victorian.

```csharp
public interface IChair
{
    string GetStyle();
}

public interface ITable
{
    string GetStyle();
}

public class ModernChair : IChair
{
    public string GetStyle()
    {
        return "Modern Chair";
    }
}

public class ModernTable : ITable
{
    public string GetStyle()
    {
        return "Modern Table";
    }
}

public class VictorianChair : IChair
{
    public string GetStyle()
    {
        return "Victorian Chair";
    }
}

public class VictorianTable : ITable
{
    public string GetStyle()
    {
        return "Victorian Table";
    }
}

public interface IFurnitureFactory
{
    IChair CreateChair();
    ITable CreateTable();
}

public class ModernFurnitureFactory : IFurnitureFactory
{
    public IChair CreateChair()
    {
        return new ModernChair();
    }

    public ITable CreateTable()
    {
        return new ModernTable();
    }
}

public class VictorianFurnitureFactory : IFurnitureFactory
{
    public IChair CreateChair()
    {
        return new VictorianChair();
    }

    public ITable CreateTable()
    {
        return new VictorianTable();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have two sets of related product interfaces and their corresponding concrete implementations for Modern and Victorian styles. The IFurnitureFactory interface defines the abstract factory, and concrete factories ModernFurnitureFactory and VictorianFurnitureFactory provide methods to create chairs and tables with specific styles.

## Use Cases
The Abstract Factory Pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to:

- Ensure that created objects are compatible and belong to a related family.
- Decouple the client code from concrete product classes.
- Easily switch between different families of related objects.

By using this pattern, you can create a framework that supports different styles or themes without modifying existing client code.

## Benefits

- Ensures that created objects are compatible.
- Promotes the creation of families of related objects.
- Decouples client code from concrete product classes.

## Drawbacks

- Adding new product families may require changes to the abstract factory interface.
