# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object, but it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling and is widely used in libraries and frameworks where a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.

## Example

Let's create a simple example of the Factory Method Pattern in C#:

```csharp
public interface IProduct
{
    string GetName();
}

public class ConcreteProductA : IProduct
{
    public string GetName()
    {
        return "Product A";
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductB : IProduct
{
    public string GetName()
    {
        return "Product B";
    }
}

public abstract class Creator
{
    public abstract IProduct FactoryMethod();
}

public class ConcreteCreatorA : Creator
{
    public override IProduct FactoryMethod()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

public class ConcreteCreatorB : Creator
{
    public override IProduct FactoryMethod()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an interface IProduct and two concrete product classes ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB. We also have an abstract class Creator with an abstract method FactoryMethod. Concrete creators ConcreteCreatorA and ConcreteCreatorB implement the FactoryMethod to create specific products.

## Use Cases

The Factory Method Pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to:

- Encapsulate object creation.
- Delegate the responsibility of creating objects to subclasses.
- Avoid tightly coupling the creator class with concrete product classes.

By using this pattern, you can create an extensible and flexible framework that allows for easy addition of new products without modifying existing code.

## Benefits

- Encapsulates object creation.
- Promotes loose coupling between creator and product classes.
- Allows for the easy addition of new products without modifying existing code.

## Drawbacks

- Can lead to an increased number of classes in the codebase.
