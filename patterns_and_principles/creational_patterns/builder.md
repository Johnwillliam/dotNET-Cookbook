# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows you to create an object step by step, with the ability to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Example

Let's create a simple example of the Builder Pattern in C# for building a computer with various components:

```csharp
// Product class
public class Computer
{
    public string CPU { get; set; }
    public string GPU { get; set; }
    public string RAM { get; set; }
    public string Storage { get; set; }
}

// Builder interface
public interface IComputerBuilder
{
    IComputerBuilder SetCPU(string cpu);
    IComputerBuilder SetGPU(string gpu);
    IComputerBuilder SetRAM(string ram);
    IComputerBuilder SetStorage(string storage);
    Computer Build();
}

// Concrete builder
public class StandardComputerBuilder : IComputerBuilder
{
    private Computer computer = new Computer();

    public IComputerBuilder SetCPU(string cpu)
    {
        computer.CPU = cpu;
        return this;
    }

    public IComputerBuilder SetGPU(string gpu)
    {
        computer.GPU = gpu;
        return this;
    }

    public IComputerBuilder SetRAM(string ram)
    {
        computer.RAM = ram;
        return this;
    }

    public IComputerBuilder SetStorage(string storage)
    {
        computer.Storage = storage;
        return this;
    }

    public Computer Build()
    {
        return computer;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a Computer class representing the product, a IComputerBuilder interface defining the builder's methods, and a concrete builder class StandardComputerBuilder that implements the builder interface to construct a computer with specific components.

## Use Cases

The Builder Pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to:

- Create complex objects with multiple parts or configurations.
- Create multiple variations of the same product using a common construction process.
- Improve the readability and maintainability of code when constructing complex objects.

By using this pattern, you can simplify the creation of complex objects while providing flexibility in the construction process.

## Benefits

- Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation.
- Allows for the step-by-step construction of objects.
- Provides the ability to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Drawbacks

- Requires the definition of a separate builder class for each product type.
