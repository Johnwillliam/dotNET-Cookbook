# Moq

Moq is a .NET library that provides a powerful and flexible framework for creating mock objects for unit testing. Mock objects are used to isolate the code under test and verify interactions with dependencies, making it easier to write effective unit tests in your .NET projects.

## Key Features

- **Mock Creation:** Moq allows you to easily create mock objects that simulate the behavior of real objects or dependencies.

- **Behavior Verification:** You can use Moq to set expectations on the behavior of mock objects and verify interactions with those objects.

- **Parameterized Testing:** Moq supports parameterized testing, making it easy to test different scenarios with varying inputs and expected outcomes.

- **Integration with Testing Frameworks:** Moq integrates with popular .NET testing frameworks such as MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit.

- **Lambda Expressions:** Moq leverages lambda expressions to set up and verify interactions with mock objects, providing a clean and expressive syntax.

## Resources

- **[Official Documentation](https://github.com/moq/moq4):** The official documentation provides detailed information on using Moq, including examples, best practices, and advanced features.

- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moq/moq4):** The GitHub repository is where you can find the latest source code, report issues, and contribute to the project.

- **[NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq/):** You can add the Moq NuGet package to your .NET projects to start creating mock objects for unit testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with Moq, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the Moq NuGet package in your project.

2. Create mock objects for the dependencies or components that your code under test interacts with.

3. Set up expectations on how these mock objects should behave when called.

4. Invoke the code under test and verify interactions with the mock objects to ensure they were used correctly.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use Moq to create a mock object and set up expectations:

Suppose you have an interface representing a data repository:

```csharp
public interface IRepository
{
    int GetCount();
}
```

You can create a unit test that uses Moq to mock this repository:

```csharp
using Moq;
using Xunit;

public class MyUnitTest
{
    [Fact]
    public void TestSomething()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockRepository = new Mock<IRepository>();
        mockRepository.Setup(r => r.GetCount()).Returns(42);

        // Act
        var result = YourCodeUnderTest.DoSomethingWithRepository(mockRepository.Object);

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(42, result);
        mockRepository.Verify(r => r.GetCount(), Times.Once);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a mock IRepository and set up an expectation that the GetCount method should return 42. We then invoke the code under test and verify the interaction.

Moq simplifies the process of creating mock objects and writing effective unit tests in your .NET projects.
