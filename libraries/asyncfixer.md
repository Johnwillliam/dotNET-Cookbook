# AsyncFixer

AsyncFixer is a code analyzer and code fix provider for asynchronous programming in .NET. It helps identify and correct common mistakes related to asynchronous code, improving the reliability and performance of your applications.

## Key Features

- **Identifying Async Anti-Patterns:** AsyncFixer detects asynchronous anti-patterns in your code, such as incorrect usage of `async` and `await`.

- **Code Fixes:** AsyncFixer provides code fixes for identified issues, helping you correct asynchronous code issues efficiently.

- **Performance Improvements:** By correcting async-related problems, AsyncFixer can lead to performance improvements in your applications.

## Resources

- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/semihokur/AsyncFixer):** The GitHub repository is the central hub for AsyncFixer, where you can find the latest source code, report issues, and contribute to the project.

- **[NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AsyncFixer/):** You can add the AsyncFixer NuGet package to your .NET projects to benefit from its code analysis and fixes.

## Getting Started

To get started with AsyncFixer, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the AsyncFixer NuGet package in your project.

2. Build your project or use your preferred IDE to analyze the code. AsyncFixer will identify issues related to asynchronous code.

3. Review the identified issues and apply the suggested code fixes to correct the async anti-patterns.

4. Rebuild your project to ensure the corrected code is free of asynchronous issues.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how AsyncFixer can help identify and correct an async anti-pattern in your code:

Suppose you have the following asynchronous method with a missing `await`:

```csharp
public async Task<int> CalculateAsync()
{
    Task.Delay(1000);
    return 42;
}
```

AsyncFixer will identify the missing await and suggest a code fix to correct the issue, resulting in the following corrected code:

```csharp
public async Task<int> CalculateAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return 42;
}
```

By applying the suggested fix, your asynchronous code becomes correct and performs as expected.

AsyncFixer is a valuable tool for maintaining clean and efficient asynchronous code in your .NET applications.
